# Help

These help images appear as hexfriends tutorial. You can add your own to your own language file to help translate!

The best way to make a translation is to copy en_us, erase the words, and write your own. Please don't change the size of the images or placement of the arrows.

There are 7 images:
- Welcome (welcome.png)
- Map (map.png)
- Settings & Saving (settings_saving.png)
- Shortcuts (shortcuts.png)
- Tools (tools.png)

Best practice is to draw the text with your mouse, but no one will get mad if you decide to use a text tool, it's just not as fun.
