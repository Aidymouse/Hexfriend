A friendly online hexmapper - you can find it at https://www.hexfriend.net

Hexfriend is a tool for building hexmaps for D&D type games. It aims to be as friendly and usable as possible.

### Feature List
A list of neat things Hexfriend can do!

-   Create square or flower shaped maps
-   Easily add and remove new hexes to the edge of the map
-   Overlay larger hexes for multi-scale maps
-   Create, add and remove custom tiles and icons
-   Export maps as images and proprietary hexfriend format (it's JSON) for sharing across computers 
-   Save maps in browser
-   Create and edit path and text styles

### Meat and Bones

Hexfriend is built with Svelte and PIXI and some quite messy typescript.
Thanks to mattjennings, without who's svelte-pixi project this would never have been possible. Go star it! https://github.com/mattjennings/svelte-pixi

### License

The software is free to use, copy, share, steal, whatever! Check the license file for real details :)
