# Hexfriend
A friendly online hexmapper - you can find it at https://www.hexfriend.net

Hexfriend is a tool for building hexmaps for D&D type games. It seeks to be as friendly and usable as possible.

### Meat and Bones
Hexfriend is built with Svelte and PIXI and some quite messy typescript.
Thanks to mattjennings, without who's svelte-pixi project this would not have been possible. Go star it! https://github.com/mattjennings/svelte-pixi
