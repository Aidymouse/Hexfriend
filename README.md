### Feature List
A list of neat things Hexfriend can do!

-   Create square or flower shaped maps
-   Draw lines, plain and dotted, and place text
-   Easily add and remove new hexes to the edge of the map
-   Show large hexes for multi-scale maps
-   Import user made custom tiles and icons
-   Create new tile or icon sets with inbuilt editors
-   Export maps as images and proprietary hexfriend format (it's JSON) for sharing across computers 
-   Save maps in browser
-   Create and edit path and text styles
-   Overlay any image on top of the map for easy tracing

### Meat and Bones

Hexfriend is built with Svelte and PIXI and some quite messy typescript.
Thanks to mattjennings, without who's svelte-pixi project this would never have been possible. Go star it! https://github.com/mattjennings/svelte-pixi

### License

The software is free to use, copy, share, steal, whatever! Check the license file for real details :)

### How to Build

Make sure you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of NPM. Just type `yarn` into the command line in the folder this readme is in to install all the dependencies. Use `yarn dev` to start a development server. Happy coding!

### Coming Soon...

Hexfriend is never finished! Here's a list of stuff to do:

-   Undo and Redo
